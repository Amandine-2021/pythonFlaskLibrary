# pythonFlaskLibrary
This is a final project I did for a Python class.   
This is a library system website.   
The project requirements were: to develop a GUI or website using Python, the use of a database, the ability to search books by title or isbn, the ability for a customer to check in or check out a book, the ability for an administrator to add a book, delete a book or edit an existing book.   
I decided to develop a website (instead of a Tkinter project) as I wanted to explore how the concepts I learned in my other web classes fit together with what I learned in the Python class.   
For this website, I used Flask, SQLite, Python, HTML, and CSS.
